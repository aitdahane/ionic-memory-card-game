# Memory Card Game
Memory Card Game is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards before the time ended. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well.
